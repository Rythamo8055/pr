- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel
- Body Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Use icons in a modern, flat style, with a slight liquid glass effect (subtle shadows and highlights) to enhance the high-tech aesthetic.
